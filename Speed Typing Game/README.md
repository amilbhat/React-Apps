## Description

The React Speed Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their typing speed. Users can start a 30-second typing test by clicking the "Start" button, and they will be prompted to type a random text passage. After 30 seconds, the app will display the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

This application is built using React, making it easy to understand and extend for further customization.
